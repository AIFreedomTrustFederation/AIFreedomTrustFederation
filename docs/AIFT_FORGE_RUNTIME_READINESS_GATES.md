# AIFT Forge Runtime Readiness Gates

This checklist protects runtime testing order.

## Gate A: Local session identity

The backend must resolve a caller from local state before any sensitive repo operation is accepted.

Ready:

- Local token records exist.
- Token creation route exists.
- Token check route exists.
- Token revocation route exists.
- Local setup route exists.
- Smart HTTP Git RPC resolves a local token identity before write-class transport is allowed.
- Anonymous Smart HTTP sessions are limited to public repository reads.

Still required:

- JSON transport request routes must use the same token actor path as Smart HTTP.
- Failed checks must produce richer local audit records with actor and request metadata.
- Re-run runtime clone/fetch/push smoke evidence after future transport policy changes.

## Gate B: Local approval policy

Mainline and release operations must have local review/status approval policy before they are trusted.

Ready:

- Approval records exist.
- Build flow records exist.
- Package and release manifest records exist.
- Local audit records exist.
- Default protected-ref policy record exists.
- Protected-ref policy check runs before Smart HTTP receive-pack execution.

Still required:

- Policy status readout.
- Review-status merge policy beyond protected-ref approval.

## Gate C: Trusted transport state

Transport behavior is only trusted after Gate A and Gate B pass.

Ready:

- Local repo storage exists.
- Local repo inspection exists.
- Read utilities exist.
- Smart transport bridge exists.
- Smart HTTP write requests require a valid local token with `repo:write` scope.
- Smart HTTP receive-pack POST requests run protected-ref policy before invoking Git.
- Disposable live Git client smoke verifies clone, fetch, feature-branch push, and protected-main denial.

Still required:

- Review/status policy for merge-class writes.
- Request size limits and streaming hardening.

## Allowed tests before all gates pass

- Health route.
- State route.
- Local setup route.
- Token route family.
- Repo init and inspect.
- Branch, tag, commit, tree, blob, and diff reads.
- Read-path transport experiments.

## Deferred until all gates pass

- Trusting production-sensitive repo updates.
- Treating remote-style repo writes as production-ready.
- Public exposure of transport endpoints.
